In JavaScript, a set is an unordered list.  This means that you cannot reliably retrieve specific list elements, as they do not have a fixed index. Instead, you can add and remove elements (duplicates are not allowed), and check whether a set contains a certain element or not.  Sets can come in handy for things like storing which users are online at a given time so you can check if they are or not.

On the other hand, a map is an ordered list of key/value pairs. While this sounds like an object, there are some important differences. For example, keys can be any value (not just strings) in maps; you can easily find its  size, and its key/value pairs can be filtered or modified in certain circumstances.
